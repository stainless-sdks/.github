# Stainless âœ¨

We're is building the platform for high-quality, easy-to-use APIs.

You can think of us like Stripe's API platform for any REST API, but our ambitions are a little bigger, and our starting point is a little narrower.

## SDKs as a Service

We provide robust & polished SDKs for your REST API.

You send us your OpenAPI spec, and we generate packages in all the major languages and publish them to npm/pypi/etc (think `npm install your-company`). These SDKs are world-class: you get an idiomatic wrapper with autocomplete, types, auto-pagination, auto-retry with backoff, etc.

Great SDKs for your API drive faster integration, broader feature adoption, quicker upgrades, and trust in your engineering quality.

Our founder [Alex](https://linkedin.com/in/alexrattray) previously built a version of this at Stripe for their SDKs, including a patent-pending codegen system and [TypeScript for the Stripe API](https://twitter.com/stripe/status/1222944951853432832).

You can see a few examples of SDKs we produce here:

- Node/TS: [lithic](https://github.com/lithic-com/lithic-node), [modern-treasury](https://github.com/Modern-Treasury/modern-treasury-node)
- Python: [increase](https://github.com/Increase/increase-python), [modern-treasury](https://github.com/Modern-Treasury/modern-treasury-python)
- Java: [increase](https://github.com/increase/increase-java), [lithic](https://github.com/lithic-com/lithic-java)
